# FreeCodeCamp Bonfires

These are my solutions to the FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges.

These might not be the most elegant or concise solutions but these are my solutions as a newbie to programming and JavaScript.

Ideally, this will serve as a way to look back at how far I've come.

Any feedback is most welcome!
